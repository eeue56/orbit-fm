    <p><strong>orbit.fm</strong> is a social music platform, or "crowd sourced radio", allowing you and everyone else 
    to decide on which music will be played at social gatherings of any nature. It's cross platform and totally userless, 
    meaning you'll never have to sign in with Facebook or Twitter, and most of all, you won't have to remember another 
    email and password combination.</p>
    <p></p>

    <strong>The Story</strong>
    <p>We got fed up of going to house parties and clubs and being stuck listening to someone else's favourite music,
    so we decided to hack out an app that would allow anyone to start collaborative music sessions.</p>
    <p>First, we aimed at three large music distribution platforms:
    
    <div class='logos'>
      <img src='img/spotify.png'></img>
      <img src='img/youtube.png'></img>
      <img src='img/soundcloud.png'></img>
    </div>

      That's access to over <strong>30 million</strong> songs. Then, over the course of 26 hours, we designed and built the thing.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <strong>How do you use it?</strong>
    <p>Here's how it goes, anyone can create a session. Just plug your phone/tablet/desktop/raspberry pi into
    some speakers, browse to <a href='http://orbit.fm'>orbit.fm</a> and click the create session button.</p>
    <p>Once you have created a session you can share the URL or grab a QR for other folks to scan. Then straight
    away, anyone who has joined the session can start adding music and you can set it off playing from your device.</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <strong>Innovation</strong>
    <p>Chances are no one is reading by this point and you're wondering what on earth we are doing.</p>
